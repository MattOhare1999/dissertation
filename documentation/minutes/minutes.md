### Main points
* Discussed the background of the project, where the data to be used originated and how it came to be.  
* Matthew said I should receive this data soon, once it has been anonymised and in the mean time said he would email me readings to help with research.  
* The programming lanaguage to be used was brought up by Matthew and I stated that I would be using Python as I am familiar with it and explained I will be doing research into libraries such as Matplotlib and this was agreed with by Matthew.
