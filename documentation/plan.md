# Plan

* Visualisation of Mobile App Usage (ID:8714)
* Matthew James O'Hare
* 2255357o
* Professor Matthew Chalmers

Week-by-week plan for the whole project.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1** Repo creation, modify template project, general reading on the topic and research/install technologies to be used eg, Python, Jupyter.  
* **Week 2** Read research papers/watch videos on the topics, get comfortable with matplotlib and other data visualisation libraries in Python.  
* **Week 3** More research and spend more time on dissertation. Readings from supervisor and other personal readings on various algorithms. Look at Iain's code from last year for guidance.  
* **Week 4** Look for potential other data sets and further research.  
* **Week 5** Evaluate Iain's code in depth and use with other data sets.  
* **Week 6** Evaluate the AppTracker data. Start out simple (easy graphs/charts etc) and get comfortable with what you're working with.  
* **Week 7** Continue with data evaluating and processing.  
* **Week 8** Continue with data evaluating and processing. Attempt to calculate distances between data points.  
* **Week 9** Filter out users using new data to get valuable dataset for visualising.
* **Week 10 - 25th Nov** Continue to filter out users (busy week due to coursework deadlines)
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]** Full time dissertation work. Aim to have a good comparison of distance metrics with different data sets (ie, different filtered users)
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted. Also attempt to create spring models using the data and metrics evaluated the week before.

## Winter break

## Spring Semester

* **Week 13 - 06th Jan** Decide on the most appropriate metric.  
* **Week 14 - 13th Jan** Use this metric with different spring model algorithms.  
* **Week 15 - 20th Jan** Decide on the most appropriate spring model algorithm.  
* **Week 16** Analysis and evaluation of the created visualisation.  
* **Week 17** Analysis and evaluation of the created visualisation.  
* **Week 18** Use detailed process with another data set.  
* **Week 19** Begin write up of dissertation - Introduction.  
* **Week 20** Continue write up of dissertation - Background.  
* **Week 21** Continue write up of dissertation - Analysis/Requirements, Design.  
* **Week 22** Continue write up of dissertation - Implementation.  
* **Week 23 [TERM ENDS]** Continue write up of dissertation - Evaluation, Conclusion.  
* **Week 24** Dissertation submission deadline and presentations.
