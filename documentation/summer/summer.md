## Research completed
Due to having an internship for 10 weeks during the summer as well as holidays, not much research was carried out. A few afternoons were spening doing some introductory reading into force directed graph drawing and the tracking of app usage to  understand the concepts of the topic however no major ideas/concerns/risks were developed or identified during the summer period.
