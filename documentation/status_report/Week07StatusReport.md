# Week 7 Status Report

A wee bit of progress since last week however not as much as hoped due to having an interview on Monday which meant most of my weekend was spent preparing for that. The main work done was further analysis on the data where I created more visualisations, cleaned up my code base and began attempting to calculate distances between users. I have also prepared notes of my findings and will outline them in the meeting tomorrow.

I feel I have a good understanding of the data so far however feel more analysis will have to be done to find the optimal dataset and data structures for using with the algorithms but overall some good progress.
