# Week 8 Status Report

Some good progress this week. I have successfully managed to calculate the hamming distance between each user. The distance can be calculated and visualised (currently in a heat map) for all apps or for any specified amount, for example, the top 100/300/500 apps. My next step is to filter out the users since not all 10,368 users provide a valuable contribution therefore I will use the extra data that Alistair has given me to do this. I have a few questions that I will ask tomorrow.

I have also been able to analyse the extra data from Alistair on its own in depth which has provided me with further information about the data set. I have made notes on these and can go over them tomorrow if you wish.
