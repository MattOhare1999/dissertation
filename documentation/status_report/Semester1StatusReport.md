* Proposal

  * Motivation

  * Aims

The project has various aims throughout it. The project will take data that has previously been used with statistical models and attempt to display them as visualisations, specifically spring models or force-directed graph layouts. This is the end goal. 

Aims leading up to this include exploring the data as much as possible and identifying key features that can help identify a user by their application usage, this includes removing anomalies and using the correct characteristics to help create an accurate model. The end result of this analysis would be a modified data set which has a valuable set of users and their features.

From this, analysis will be carried out to find the best metric for comparing rows in this data (each row represents a user) such as hamming distance, cosine similarity and others.

The project will then explore the possible spring model algorithms on offer such as Chalmers 96, PCA, t-SNE and UMAP. This modified data set along with the best metric will be used with these algorithms to create a spring model layout to help us visualise this high dimensional data in 2 and 3 dimensional space.

  * Progress - Language chosen: The project will be implemented in Python 3
Background research carried out on spring model algorithms such as PCA, t-SNE and UMAP.
Background research carried out on where the initial app usage data came from and how it was harvested.

 (what else)
Explored and analysed data to find the best metrics, features and other stuff

* Problems and Risks

  * Problems

Due to the large data set, runtimes are long.
These algorithms can change output dramatically when different metrics are used therefore the correct one must be found. 

  * Risks 

* Plan

* Ethics and Data

This project does not involve human subjects or data. No approval required.
