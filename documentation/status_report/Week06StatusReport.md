# Week 6 Status Report

After receiving the data on Friday from Alistair, I have spent the full week evaluating, understanding and processing the data set. I will explain my results further on Friday during our Skype call but I will outline some details here. With 45788 apps and 10368 users it is extremely large so will take most of this next week to finish analysing to a good standard although this may go on longer.

I have found the range of the apps used by users to be massive with one app being used by 10173 users and quite a lot only being used by 1. Therefore as spoke about last week, these extreme outliers may have to be omitted for the final data set but I will see how this goes when plotting more charts. I have currently got the data saved in a (very sparse) pandas data frame although I will also be looking for alternatives to make it more efficient since some calculations do take some time due to the size.

Overall it is going well and I will continue to evaluate this coming week.
