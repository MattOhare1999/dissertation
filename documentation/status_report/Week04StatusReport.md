# Week 4 Status Report

I attended the GUTS Hackathon this weekend from Friday till Sunday therefore not much work was done over the weekend. However, this worked out well since I did not have much to work on, in terms of the project, while Alistair is finishing setting up the data. 

This past week I have been trying to find the data set used in the "Differentiating smartphone user by app usage" (Welke et al.) paper. However having found the startup you mentioned in the meeting - The Menthal Framework - I am struggling to find the data set from it online anywhere however I will continue to look.

I also looked and found the Carat data set however it was the same one that Alistair found in our meeting last week so I'm unsure if there is another one but it does not seem to be very useful for this project. Furthermore, a few additional readings were carried out along with some more work in python and matplotlib.
