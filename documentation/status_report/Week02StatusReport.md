# Week 2 Status Report

In the last week, as agreed in the last meeting, the majoirty of the work I have done has been research and reading. I have read and made notes now on all of the recommended readings that you gave me, as well as others that I found myself, and have looked into and made notes on spring models, t-SNE and UMAP (and watched the video you suggested), as discussed last week.

I have looked at Iain's code from last year and have run it trying all of the algorithms and different test data and parameters. I feel I have a good understanding of this. I have also done some more python and matplotlib revision in this time.
