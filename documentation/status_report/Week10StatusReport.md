# Week 10 Status Report

As stated last week I have had a lot of coursework due this week therefore although I have made progress, there is not much to show in terms of visualisations like the last few weeks. I have however managed to merge the different data together to create a filter to exclude users based on the duration we have seen them and their total launches. The filter can be easily changed or altered once I have evaluated the results with the similarity metrics. There were some anomalies I discovered with some users. For example, in a 50 day period, one user only used 7 apps with a total of 22 launches in that time therefore I am unsure how valuable this user is. Also instead of having just 1s and 0s in my dataframe for recording whether a user has used an app or not, I have also been able to show the launch count of each app by a user.

My next step was then to use these filtered users and modified dataframe in my hamming distance formula and take into account the average usage of each app across the whole data set (as mentioned in last week's meeting) to give a better distance (or similarity) measure. Also I was going to attempt to try other metrics and compare results but unfortunately I never got the chance to do this therefore this will be done this coming week once all coursework is finished.
