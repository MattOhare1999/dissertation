# Week 18 Status Report

Some general tidying up of the code and visualisations this week. Used some in-built functions to display various metrics for the spring models like stress, memory usage and runtime as well as plotting velocity against iterations.

Apart from that, most of my focus has been on starting to plan and write the dissertation. I have created a plan for each chapter, in terms of headings and what I want to cover in each section. I have started on the implementation section so far.
