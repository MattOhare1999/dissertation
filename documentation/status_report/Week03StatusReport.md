# Week 3 Status Report

Since last weeks meeting, there has not been much overall progress with the project. As I am waiting for Alistair to finish anonymising the data and convert it into the form suggested, this week has once again, mostly been a research week.

I have found the repository where Iain obtained the poker data set from last year and found it to be computer generated and not based on real life hands. While browsing this repository I also found a mobile usage data set that looked like it could be used instead (at least while I was waiting for our data) for visualisations however it was only a small study (35 users) and the data contained a lot of irrelevant fields for the purposes of our project.

Research work included readings and videos found by myself to further my understanding of certain topics like UMAP, spring models and AWARE.
