# Week 9 Status Report

Most of my time this past week has been spent completing coursework for all my modules therefore although there was some, not too much progress was made. I have started to filter the users by the duration we seen them. There are just over 2000 users that we seen for less than 5 minutes and 4600 that we have seen for less than 1 day. I was going to discuss how long we would need to see a user for to class them as 'valuable', before continuing with the filtering. I was thinking I may need to incorporate actual user activity for this potentially, ie. how many times they have launched their apps. I have also managed to sort out the problem with the hamming distance that I had last week, the heat map now looks more like it should and the values seem more accurate. I will show them in the meeting tomorrow.
