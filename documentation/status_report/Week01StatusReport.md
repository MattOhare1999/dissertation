# Week 1 Status Report

In the past week I have created my repo and installed the technologies required for the project (Anaconda and Python). I spent most of my time gathering background knowledge from the resources you have provided, although I have not read them all yet as I am taking notes alongside each reading to give me a better understanding and to save time if needing to reference.

I have had a brief look at matplotlib in Python to refresh my memory of it however that will be done further this coming week.

For organising references and managing a bibliography, I have downloaded and set up Zotero for this.
