# Week 16 Status Report

As mentioned in last week's meeting I was away from Friday to Monday therefore that combined with other university work, not much progress was made this week. Some analysis was done regrading improving the visualisation of the kmeans algorithm and the identification of clusters in the spring model visualisations however not much to note thus far. I also began writing a template with appropriate headings for the dissertation as I'm aware this will have to be started soon.

Overall, not much notable progress to show tomorrow but I plan on making up all outstanding work this coming week to catch up and get back on track with my plan.
