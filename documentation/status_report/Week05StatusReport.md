# Week 5 Status Report

Once again, not much to report this week while the data is being processed. The main thing I have been working on this past week was using Iain's code with the mnist digits dataset. I have had some success with this however not as much as I would have liked. Graphs are being created and the data points are being plotted however there is not much structure in terms of grouping similar digits together. I am still currently debugging this to find out whether this is caused by the metric or another issue. Last week Alistair asked me to bring my stuff to the meeting tomorrow and show him so we can hopefully identify the error in the metric.

Other than that, some more readings were carried out but nothing significant as the main focus was on using mnist with Iain's code.
