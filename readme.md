# Level 4 Individual Project - Matthew James O'Hare
## Visualisation of Mobile App Usage

This is the project repository for my individual dissertation project undertaken during my 4th year at the University of Glasgow. This project was supervised by Professor Matthew Chalmers.

The aim of this project was to visualise mobile app usage in an informative and meaningful way, in doing so six Dimensionality Reduction algorithms were implemeted to compare and evaluate visualisations. The source code for this project including documentation and requirements can be found in `src/`.

The structure of the project is as follows:

* `timelog.md` Cointains the time log of the project.
* `plan.md` Contains a skeleton week-by-week plan of the project. 
* `data/` Contains the notebook used for data evaluation as well as a selection of layouts created from the algorithms.
* `src/` Contains source code of the project.
* `documentation` Contains all meeting minutes, notes and status reports.
* `dissertation/` Contains all source materials for project dissertation.
* `presentation/` Contains project presentation.
* `.gitignore` Current .gitignore files.
